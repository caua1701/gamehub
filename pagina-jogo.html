            <p>
                Red Dead Redemption is a third-person open-world  adventure game which implements the Wild West at its best: it is very  much GTA-clone but in bizarre stylistics and the very beginning of the  twentieth century. This is the second title of a franchise, being  preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2  coming out in late 2018.<br> 
                We play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals  and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most  interesting one is "Dead Eye" — it allows one to point multiple targets  out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously.<br>
                The game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has  zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the  original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite  amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the  particular piece of land to gain control of it.
